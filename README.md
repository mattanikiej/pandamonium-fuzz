## Features 3 Different Fuzz Modes

* ### White
    Uses a standard soft clipping equation used in many fuzz models. Fuzz lowers the threshold of clipping.
* ### Red
    Hard clipping for that harsh fuzz sound that cuts through any mix. Fuzz lowers the threshold of clipping.

## Build
This plugin is built using the JUCE framework. See the [repository](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE) or [website](https://juce.com/) for instructions on downloading and building projects with Projucer.

Once the project is built, move the AU or VST3 file where those files are generally installed on your machine. Then you can use your DAW to use the plug in.
