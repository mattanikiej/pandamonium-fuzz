## Files Supported
Currently **Pandamonium** is only available as a **VST3** or **AU** plugin, which is supported by most types of DAWs. It also works as a standalone app without the need for a DAW. It has not been tested or compiled as an AAX file for Pro Tools, but it should build and work if you have the license and SDK.

## Build
This plugin is built using the JUCE framework. See their [repository](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE) or [website](https://juce.com/) for instructions on downloading and building projects with Projucer. Once the project is built, move the AU or VST3 file where those files are generally installed on your machine.

Some tips for development:
The [JUCE Plugin Tutorial Part 1](https://docs.juce.com/master/tutorial_create_projucer_basic_plugin.html) has a very good tutorial on how to set up their host to connect to the plugin. This is extremely useful as it becomes much easier to use your IDE's debugger, and you're not reliant on a DAW to hear your plugin.
